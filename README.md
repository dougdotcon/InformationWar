## Project Overview
This repository hosts the **FT-PHY-001 Protocol**, a computational framework designed to bridge the gap between Theoretical Statistical Physics and High-Frequency Market Intelligence. By treating social platforms not as unstructured data lakes but as thermodynamic systems governed by the Ising Hamiltonian, we allow for the rigorous quantification of social consensus, polarization, and market susceptibility.

The system operates on three hierarchical levels:
1.  **Theoretical Simulation**: Modeling the topology of influence.
2.  **Market Observation**: Converting social metadata into physical observables.
3.  **Semantic Engineering**: Extracting the vectors of maximum resonance (Pain/Sales coupling).

## Phase 1: The Ising-Barabási Simulation
We model social networks as Scale-Free graphs (Barabási-Albert topology) where users interact via a modified Ising Hamiltonian:

$$ H = -J \sum_{\langle i,j \rangle} s_i s_j - h \sum_i s_i $$

*   **J (Coupling Constant)**: Social pressure/Homophily.
*   **h (External Field)**: Algorithmic bias, marketing, or propaganda.
*   **s (Spin)**: The binary state of adoption (Accept/Reject).

### Key Findings
*   **The 3% Tipping Point**: Pinning Control simulations demonstrated that ensuring the loyalty of just **3%** of the network (specifically high-Eigenvector Centrality hubs) is sufficient to irreversibly invert the global consensus of the network, even against a persistent external field. This defines the "Oligarchy of the Hubs".

## Phase 2: Reddit Market Physics
Transitioning from simulation to reality, we mapped Reddit communities to canonical ensembles.
*   **Susceptibility ($\chi$)**: Defined as the fluctuation of the order parameter (Sentiment/Pain), serving as a proxy for Market Volatility and "Gold Rush" potential.
*   **Portfolio Scanning**: Real-time monitoring of multiple sectors (e.g., r/Entrepreneur, r/Investing) identified r/Entrepreneur as a critical system ($\chi \approx 0.70$) with high latent demand dynamics.

## Phase 3: Semantic Field Engineering
Using the data from the critical systems, we extract the "Interaction Energy" of specific keywords. By calculating the correlation between Term Frequency and the product of Pain Score (Spin) and Visibility (External Field), we generate a **Pain Cloud**.

*   **Vocabulário de Ataque**: Words like "Problem", "Without", and "Building" were identified as having the highest cross-section for engagement, serving as the basis for "High-Q" copywriting.

## Strategic Insights for Business & State
This framework provides a deterministic approach to social engineering:

1.  **For Corporations**: Stop "guessing" audience sentiment. Use the Susceptibility metric ($\chi$) to identify when a market niche is thermodynamically ready for a phase transition (product launch).
2.  **For Intelligence**: Monitor the Magnetization ($M$) of social graphs. A sudden drop in $M$ on specific sub-networks precedes macroscopic social unrests or trend reversals.
3.  **For Marketing**: Do not target the masses. Target the Topological Elite (3%). Identifying and converting these nodes yields a lower energy cost for global system adoption than broad-spectrum advertising.
